You'll get a docker container with Postgres 12 and some simulated workload.

Wait until container is pulled and launched. Normally, it takes not more than 1 minute.

Once it's done you'll be already inside the container.

If something goes wrong, feel free to reload the page and start over again. All the steps are independent so you can skip any of them.
