You'll get a Docker container with:

- Postgres 12,
- bunch of various tools preinstalled,
- standard database generated by pgbench, with some modifications,
- and some simulated workload.

Wait until Docker image is pulled and the container is launched. Normally, it takes ~1 minute.

Once it's ready you will get the message that it's ready. By that time, you'll be already inside the container.

If something goes wrong, feel free to reload the page and start over again. All the steps are independent so you can skip any of them.
